<h3 class="aboutus">TIRUMALA BUILDERS is committed to providing you a higher quality of life and redefining standard of living through innovative real estate products. We distinctively differentiate ourselves through our unvarying focus on 3 core values - Customer Centricity, Quality and Transparency. We have consistently stood at the forefront of design, raising the bar on aesthetics, functionality, infrastructure and eco-friendliness.

Our offerings range from residential condominiums, row houses, villas, serviced apartments, hotels, resorts, spas, business parks, SEZs, integrated townships to retail malls. Our projects are currently being implemented in Bangalore, Chennai and Goa.

Ozonegroup's key differentiator is the abundant infrastructure in all our projects. We address the most basic needs like Water, Power and Security besides providing high-end conveniences and creature comforts with similar attention that form the important essentials that drive our business objectives. Every project of Ozonegroup has well designed infrastructure such as wide internal roads, adequate car parks for residents and their visitors, large open green spaces with water features, effective security systems, besides carefully chosen high quality building materials. We also invest significantly to make our projects environment friendly, through rain water harvesting, solar heating and lighting, waste management and other similar eco-friendly features. 

We firmly believe that customer delight is our proudest outcome not only in the environment we create around them, but also in the ready and committed service we provide
